This logs you in as user "vagrant". Sudo to root.

vagrant$ sudo su - root

Initialize the ssh files under root login:

vagrant$ ssh-keygen

Copy your public key from your *host* machine's ~/.ssh/ folder to file .ssh/authorized_keys on the vagrant machine. One method: copy to clipboard your public key on the host system, then go to terminal and:

vagrant$ echo {paste your key here!}>>.ssh/authorized_keys

cp {my-public-key} .ssh/authorized_keys

Change the sshd_config file to reflect these settings (add if not present):

  PermitRootLogin without-password
  RSAAuthentication yes
  PubkeyAuthentication yes

vim isn't on root's path, but vi is, so:

vagrant$ vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

should work.  Then restart the ssh service:

vagrant$ service ssh restart

Then get out of vagrant (control-d or logout a few times). Now from your host system try it out! Log in as such:

ssh root@127.0.0.1 -p 2222

or if you're using my updated Vagrantfile

ssh root@192.168.2.200
